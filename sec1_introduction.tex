\section{Introduction}
The prevalence of positioning devices has drastically boosted 
the scale and spectrum of trajectory collection to an unprecedented level. 
Tremendous amounts of trajectories, in the form of sequenced spatial-temporal 
records, are continually generated from animal telemetry chips, 
vehicle GPSs and wearable devices. Data analysis on large-scale 
trajectories benefits a wide range of applications and services, 
including traffic planning~\cite{zheng2011urban}, animal analysis~\cite{li2010miningperiodic}, and social recommendations~\cite{bao2013survey}, to name just a few.


A crucial task of data analysis on top of trajectories is 
to discover co-moving patterns. A \emph{co-movement} pattern~\cite{li2013managing} 
refers to a group of objects traveling together for a certain period of time 
and the group is normally determined by spatial proximity. 
A pattern is prominent if the size of the group exceeds $M$ and the length of the duration exceeds $K$, where $M$ and $K$ are parameters specified by users. Rooted from such basic definition 
and driven by different mining applications, there are a bunch of variants 
of co-movement patterns that have been developed with more advanced constraints.

Table~\ref{tbl:existing_co_patterns} summarizes several popular co-moving pattern s 
with different constraints in the attributes of clustering in spatial proximity,
consecutiveness in temporal duration and computational complexity. 
In particular,  the \emph{flock}~\cite{gudmundsson2006flock} 
and the \emph{group}~\cite{wang2006grouppattern} patterns require 
all the objects in a group to be enclosed by a disk with radius $r$; 
whereas the \emph{convoy}~\cite{jeung2008convoy}, the \emph{swarm}~\cite{li2010swarm} 
and the \emph{platoon}~\cite{li2015platoon} patterns resort to density-based 
spatial clustering. 
In the temporal dimension, the \emph{flock}~\cite{gudmundsson2006flock} 
and the \emph{convoy}~\cite{jeung2008convoy} require all the timestamps 
of each detected spatial group to be consecutive, which is referred to as \emph{global consecutiveness}; 
whereas the \emph{swarm}~\cite{li2010swarm} does not impose any restriction. 
The \emph{group}~\cite{wang2006grouppattern} and the \emph{platoon}~\cite{li2015platoon} adopt a compromised manner by allowing
arbitrary gaps between the consecutive segments, which is called \emph{local consecutiveness}. 
They introduce a parameter $L$ to control the minimum length of each local consecutive segment.

\label{fig:related_work}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:related_work} is an example to demonstrate the concepts of various co-movement patterns. The trajectory database consists of six moving objects and the temporal dimension is discretized into six snapshots. In each snapshot, we treat the clustering methods as a black-box and assume that they generate the same clusters. Objects in proximity are grouped in the dotted circles. As aforementioned, there are three parameters to determine the co-movement patterns and the default settings in this example are $M=2$, $K=3$ and $L=2$. Both the \emph{flock} and the \emph{convoy} require the spatial clusters to last for at least $K$ consecutive  timestamps. Hence,$\{o_3,o_4\}$ and $\{o_5,o_6\}$  remains the only two candidates matching the patterns. The \textit{swarm} relaxes the pattern matching by discarding the temporal consecutiveness constraint. Thus, it generates many more candidates than the \textit{flock} and the \textit{convoy}. The \textit{group} and the \textit{platoon} add another constraint on local consecutiveness to retain meaningful patterns. For instance, $\{o_1,o_2:1,2,4,5\}$ is a pattern matching local consecutiveness because timestamps $\{1,2\}$ and $\{4,5\}$ are two segments with length no smaller than $L=2$. The difference between the \textit{group} and the \textit{platoon} is that the \textit{platoon} has an additional parameter $K$ to specify the minimum number of snapshots for the spatial clusters. This explains why $\{o_3,o_4,o_5:2,3\}$ is a  \textit{group} pattern but not a \textit{platoon} pattern.

As can be seen, there are various co-movement patterns requested by different 
applications and it is cumbersome to design a tailored solution for each type. 
As pointed in \cite{li2015platoon, li2010swarm}, stringent temporal constraints (e.g., global consecutiveness on \emph{flock} and \emph{convoy}) may miss out many interesting patterns. However, we observe that pattern definitions with overly-relaxed temporal constraints (e.g., \emph{swarm}, \emph{group} and \emph{platoon}) lose the fine control of a pattern which introduce noisy results and unnecessary computations. We name this scenario as \emph{loose-connection} anomaly. To illustrate, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:platoon_weakpoint}, the two objects $o_1, o_2$ form a \emph{platoon} pattern 
$\{o_1,o_2:1,2,3,102,103,104\}$. However, the consecutive segments are $98$ timestamps apart, 
making the co-moving behavior very loose.
In reality, such an anomaly is likely induced by the periodic movements of unrelated objects 
such as, vehicles stopping at the same petrol station, animals pausing at the same water source etc.  Interestingly, none of the temporal-relaxed patterns (e.g., \emph{swarm}, \emph{group} and \emph{platoon}) is able to avoid such an anomaly directly.

%In addition, existing pattern definitions are not expressive enough and may miss 
%interesting patterns or return noisy results. We summarize 
%the two scenarios as \emph{missing-pattern} anomaly
%and \emph{loose-connection} anomaly.
%A \emph{missing-pattern} anomaly arises due to the stringent constraints on the pattern duration.
%As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:platoon_weakpoint} (a), if we set $K=4$, 
%neither \emph{flock}s nor \emph{convoy}s can be discovered. This is because
%$o_1$ is away from $o_2$ at timestamp $4$, which is likely caused by
%the traffic control or the clustering inaccuracy at time $4$. On the other hand,
%the \emph{loose-connection} anomaly occurs due to an over-relaxed constraint on 
%the duration. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:platoon_weakpoint} (b),
%the two objects $o_1, o_2$ form a \emph{platoon} pattern 
%$\{o_1,o_2:1,2,3,102,103,104\}$. However, the consecutive segments are $98$ timestamps apart, 
%making the co-moving behavior very weak.
%In reality, such an anomaly is likely to be induced by the periodic movements of unrelated objects 
%such as, vehicles stopping at the same petrol station, animals pausing at the same water source etc. 
%It is easy to see that none of the existing co-movement patterns are able to avoid these two anomalies.

%In current literature,
%users are unable to explicitly exclude the loosely-connected patterns even when those patterns are unwanted.
%
%
% we summarize two anomalies 
%The \emph{missing-pattern}~\cite{li2010swarm} anomaly arises due to the stringent constraints on the duration of a pattern. As shown in 
%Figure~\ref{fig:platoon_weakpoint} (a).  As we notice, object $o_1$ is temporally far from $o_2$ at timestamp $4$, which is likely to be
%the result of errors in interpretation of missing points, or $o_1$ faces traffic control at time $4$. Such an anomaly can
%be resolved by \emph{swarm} and \emph{platoon} due to a relaxed constraint on the duration. However, 
%\emph{swarm} and \emph{platoon}'s relaxations encompass a type of non-interesting patterns which is referred
%as \emph{loose-connection}~\cite{li2015platoon} anomaly. 
%
%
%%This is because that \emph{platoon} allows the timestamps in a pattern duration to be in arbitrary distance, making the object group loosely
%connected. For instance, patterns with duration $\{1,2,100,101\}$ could be a valid \emph{platoon}; however, the two timestamps $2,100$ are too far from each other.

%For instance, PUT THE FIGURE AND EXPLANATION HERE.

The other issue with existing methods is that they are 
built on top of centralized indexes that are not scalable. 
To the best of our knowledge, the maximum number of trajectories 
ever evaluated is up to hundreds of trajectories. 
In practice, it is rather common to collect at least hundreds of thousands of trajectories 
and their scalability is left unknown. We conduct a theoretical analysis on the worst-case complexity (as listed in Table~\ref{tbl:existing_co_patterns}) as well as an experimental evaluation with a real trajectory database including million-scale points(as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:related_work_scalability}). 
Results show that their performances degrade dramatically as the dataset size scales up. For instances,
performance of \emph{swarm} drops five times as the number of objects grows from \emph{1k} to \emph{2k}. Similarly,
performance of \emph{group} drops over seven times as the number of snapshots grows from \emph{1.5k} to \emph{2.4k}.
It is easy to spot that none of the existing solutions are scalable to handle large-scale trajectories which may include billion-scale points.
%In fact, as shown in Table~, the mining of co-movement patterns require high complexity. For instance, the
%complexities of \emph{swarm} and \emph{platoon} are already exponential. 
%Therefore, none of them can handle millions of trajectories efficiently.

Therefore, our primary contributions in this paper are to close these two gaps. 
First, we propose the \emph{general co-movement pattern} (GCMP) which models
various co-moment patterns in a unified way while avoids 
the \emph{loose-connection} anomaly. In GCMP, we gain a
fine-grained control over pattern duration by introducing the gap 
parameter $G$, which enforces the gap between 
timestamps to be no larger than $G$.  
The adoption of $G$ seamlessly integrates with other pattern parameters,
which preserves the expressiveness while
alleviates the \emph{loose connection} anomalies.

%Therefore, users are 
%still able to exclude non-consecutive patterns 
%or include loosely-connected patterns when they feel necessary.


%We introduce the gap parameter $G$,
%When such loosely-connected patterns are unwanted, users currently are unable to directly control the outputs.
%To cope with both of the two anomalies, we propose 
%by introducing the gap parameter $G$, 

%By so doing, we gain a fine-grained control s, which As we show in later sections, the general co-movement pattern is able to express existing patterns by setting appropriate parameters. 
%IS IT POSSIBLE TO USE FIGURE 1 TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF PLATOON, INSTEAD OF PROPOSING A NEW EXAMPLE SCENARIO?

Second, we propose a parallel solution on modern MapReduce platforms for scalable pattern mining.
The major challenge in designing MapReduce-based algorithms is to make proper partitions of input data.
In GCMP mining, we enforce both the \emph{soundness} and the \emph{completeness} 
of the partitions. Such properties ensure that neither false-patterns 
nor miss-patterns are possible in our solution. To meet such partition requirements
as well as to keep the shuffle amount to a minimum, 
we first design a naive \emph{Temporal Replication and Mining} (TRM)
approach, which partitions trajectories into groups of consecutive snapshots. Then, we design a line-sweep
method for mining GCMP from each partition. We prove that in TRM, the partition is complete and sound when a snapshot is replicated $O(|T|)$ times. 
Then, we design a novel \emph{Star Partition and Mining} (SRM) approach which significantly reduces the data shuffled
as compare to TRM. In SRM, we design a conceptual connection graph based on proximity among objects. We adapt
a \emph{star partition} which cut the graph by replicating vertices. Afterwards, we design an Apriori-like method to mine
GCMP in each partition. We prove the correctness of SPM and show that total data been replicated is $O(|\mathbb{O}|)$. 
Despite the simpleness of star partition, we theoretically prove its optimality.
Furthermore, we utilize \emph{temporal monotonicity} to further reduce the 
shuffling and mining cost in SPM. 
%Lastly, we adapt various engineering level techniques to support efficiently deploying our algorithms in 
%Apache Spark which is one of the most popular MapReduce platforms.

%we design a novel star-based partition scheme to efficiently partition objects based on their
%belonging clusters. Based on the star partition, we then propose a series of optimization techniques which
%largely improve the system performance. NEED TO EMPHASIZE YOUR TECHNICAL CONTRIBUTION!
