% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}
%With the advances of modern positioning technologies, tremendous trajectory data are nowadays become widely available. Discovering insightful information out of such large-scale trajectories is  important. Previous researches 
%have identified several interesting co-movement patterns and showcased their usefulness. However, we observe two challenges in applying them over large-scale trajectories. First, there is lack of a uniform definition of co-movement pattern, which makes it cumbersome to design a tailored solution to feed different needs. Second, existing works are all centralized schemes which are failed to scale to hundreds of millions of trajectories. 
%
%Motivated by this, in this paper, we present our novel solution on detecting co-movement patterns over large-scale trajectories. First, we model a general co-movement pattern (GCMP) to capture co-moving behaviors of objects. GCMP is versatile in representing all existing patterns by introducing a \emph{gap} constraints. With the gap, GCMP is also free from the so-called \emph{loose-connection} anomaly which appears in existing methods. Second, we resort to MapReduce for a parallel GCMP mining solution.
%%
%% We design a Temporal Replication and Parallel Mining (TRPM) method by replicating and grouping neighboring snapshots for effective parallelism. 
%We propose a novel Star Partition and ApRiori Enumerator (SPARE) to facilitate efficient parallelism. In SPARE, we model the pair-wised connections between objects as an Aggregate Graph and partition the graph into stars. Such a partition scheme guarantees no duplicate patterns are found from different partitions. For each star, SPARE employs an ApRiori Enumerator to systemically detect all valid GCMPs. As the traditional \emph{monotonicity} property in Apriori no longer holds, we develop the temporal based \emph{monotonicity} property to support efficient enumeration. We experiments our SPARE detector on three real datasets upto 200 million points using Apache Spark. The results show that SPARE achieves 90 times efficiency than centralized schemes and 10 times efficiency than a parallel baseline. Our experiments also demonstrates an almost linear scalability.

Discovering co-movement patterns from large-scale trajectory databases is an important mining task and has a wide spectrum of applications. Previous studies have identified several types of interesting co-movement patterns and showcased their usefulness. In this paper, we make two key contributions to this research field. First, we propose a more general co-movement pattern to unify those defined in the past literature. Second, we propose two types of parallel and scalable frameworks and deploy them on Spark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to mine co-movement patterns in a trajectory database with hundreds of millions of points. Experiments on three large-scale trajectory datasets verified the efficiency and scalability of our proposed solutions.
