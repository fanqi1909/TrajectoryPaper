\section{Definitions}
\label{sec:definition}
Let $\mathbb{O} = \{o_1 ,o_2,...,o_n\}$ be the set of objects and $\mathbb{T} =\{1,2,...,m\}$ be the descritized temporal dimension. A time sequence $T$ is defined as a subset of $\mathbb{T}$, i.e., $T \subseteq \mathbb{T}$, and we use $|T|$ to denote sequence length. Let $T_i$ be $i$-th entry in $T$ and we say $T$ is consecutive if $\forall 1\leq i\leq |T|-1$, $T_{i+1} = T_i + 1$. It is obvious that any time sequence $T$ can be decomposed into consecutive segments and we say $T$ is \textit{L-consecutive}~\cite{li2015platoon} if the length of all the consecutive segments is no smaller than $L$. 

To control the closeness of timestamps, we further define the $G$-connected of a time sequence as follows: WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLOSENESS AND G-CONNECTED?


%
%
%We say a sequence $T$ is \emph{(fully)consecutive}
%if and only if $\forall T[i] \in T, T[i+1] \in T$, $T[i+1] = T[i] + 1$. A subsequence $T^m$ is \emph{maximally consecutive}~\cite{li2015platoon} wrt. $T$ if and only if $T^m \subseteq T$ and $\nexists T^{m'}, T^m \subseteq T^{m'} \wedge T^{m'} $ is consecutive. For example, let $T=\{1,2,3,5,6\}$, then $T_1=\{1,2,3\}$ and $T_2=\{5,6\}$ are two maximally consecutive subsequences wrt. $T$. We then define the $L$-consecutiveness as follows:

%\begin{definition}[$L$-consecutive~\cite{li2015platoon}]
%A time sequence $T$ is $L$-consecutive if each of its consecutive portions 
%has cardinality greater or equal to $L$.
%\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[$G$-connected]
A time sequence $T$ is $G$-connected if the gap between any of its neighboring timestamps is no greater than $G$. That is
 $\forall T[i],T[i+1] \in T, T[i+1]-T[i] \leq G$.
\end{definition}

We take $T=\{1,2,3,5,6\}$ as an example, which can be decomposed into two consecutive segments $\{1,2,3\}$ and $\{5,6\}$. $T$ is not $3$-consecutive since the length $\{5,6\}$ is $2$. Thus, it is safe to say either $T$ is $1$-consecutive or $2$-consecutive. On the other hand, $T$ is $2$-connected since the maximum gap between its neighboring time stamps is $5-3=2$. It is worth noting that $T$ is not $1$-connected because XXX.

%Given a timestamp $t$, objects with their locations at $t$ collectively form a \emph{snapshot}\footnote{Missing time stamps can be interpreted using existing methods such as linear interpolation~\cite{jeung2008convoy}.}.Objects in a snapshot can then be clustered based on the closeness of their locations. Let $C_t(o_i)$ be the cluster which $o_i$ belongs to at time $t$, a general co-movement pattern can be defined as:
Given a trajectory database descritized into snapshots, we can conduct a clustering method, either disk-based or density-based, to identify groups with spatial proximity. Let $T$ be the set of timestamps in which a group of objects $O$ are clustered. We are ready to define a more general co-movement pattern:
\begin{definition}[General Co-Movement Pattern]
A general co-movement pattern finds a set of objects $O$ satisfying the following five constraints: 1) \textit{closeness:} the objects in $O$ belong to the same cluster in the timestamps of $T$; 2) \textit{significance:} $|O| \geq M$; 3) \textit{duration:} $|T| \geq K$; 4) \textit{consecutiveness:} $T$ is L-consecutive; and 5) \textit{connection:} $T$ is $G$-connected.

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item{Closeness: $\forall o_i,o_j \in O, \forall t \in T, C_t(o_i) = C_t(o_j)$}
%\item{Significance: $|O| \geq M$}
%\item{Duration: $|T| \geq K$}
%\item{Consecutiveness: $T$ is $L$-consecutive}
%\item{Separateness: $T$ is $G$-separated}
%\end{enumerate} 
\end{definition}
There are XXX parameters in our general co-movement pattern, including XXX. By customizing these parameters, our pattern can be reduced to the patterns proposed in previous literature, as illustrated in Table~\ref{tbl:patterns}. In particular, by setting $G=|T|$, we achieve the \emph{platoon} pattern. By setting $G=|T|,L=1$, we achieve the \emph{swarm} pattern. By setting $G=|T|$, $M=2$, $K=1$, we gain the \emph{group} pattern. Finally by setting $G=1$, we achieve the \emph{convoy} and \emph{flock} pattern. 
In addition to covering existing patterns, the general co-movement pattern avoids the \emph{loose connection} problem in \emph{platoon} pattern. As suggested previously, $\{1,2, 100,101\}$ will be included in the platoon pattern, however since they're too far away, this pattern is not prominent. By setting appropriate $G$, we are able to prune this anomaly. It is notable that GCMP is not able to be modeled by existing patterns. AS MENTIONED IN WECHAT, POLISH THIS PART.

%The general co-movement pattern retains the patterns that discovered by all 
%existing techniques (group, flock, convoy, swarm and platoon). 
%The relationships between general co-movement pattern and other patterns are summarized

It is also observable that the number of patterns in GCMP is exponential. To control the size of output, 
we notice that, for two patterns $P_1,P_2$, if $P_1.O \subseteq P_2.O$ and $P_2$ is a proper pattern, then $P_1$ is also a proper pattern. Therefore, we can define the \emph{Closed General Co-Movement Pattern} as follows:

\begin{definition}[Closed General Co-Movement Pattern]
A general co-moving pattern $P=\langle O, T \rangle$ is closed if and only if there does not exist another general co-moving pattern $P'$ s.t. $P.O \subseteq P'.O$.
\end{definition}

For example, let $n=2,k=2,l=1,g=1$, the pattern $\{o_1,o_2\}\{1,2,3,4\}$ is not a closed pattern, while $\{o_1,o_2,o_3\}$ $\{1,2,3,4\}$ is a closed pattern. The closed pattern avoids outputting duplicate information, thus making the result patterns more compact. 

LETS KEEP THE CLOSED INFORMATION AT THE MOMENT. IF NO CLOSED IS DEFINED, WE CANNOT REDUCE GCMP TO OTHER PATTERNS SINCE THOSE PATTERNS ARE ALL DEFINED AS ``CLOSED''
%For example, let $n=2,k=2,l=1,g=1$, the pattern $\{o_3,o_4\} \{1,2,3\}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:related_work} is not a closed pattern, while $\{o_3, o_4\} \{t_1,t_2,t_3\}$ is a closed pattern. 

%Although the general co-moving pattern is free from the clustering methods used at each snapshot, as suggested in~\cite{jeung2008convoy}, the \emph{density}-based clustering method is better in detecting object clusters with arbitrary spatio-shapes. Therefore in this paper, we mainly consider density-based clustering.
Our definition of GCMP is free from clustering method. Users are able to supply different clustering method to facilitate different needs. We currently expose both disk-region based clustering and DBSCAN as options to the user.

In summary, the goal of this paper is to present a parallel solution for discovering closed GCMP from large-scale trajectory data.
