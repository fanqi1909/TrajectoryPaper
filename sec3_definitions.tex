\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:definition}
Let $\mathbb{O} = \{o_1 ,o_2,...,o_n\}$ be the set of objects and $\mathbb{T} =(1,2,...,N)$ be the discretized temporal dimension. A time sequence $T$ is defined as an ordered subset of $\mathbb{T}$. Given two time sequences $T_1$ and $T_2$, we define commonly-used operators in this paper in Table~\ref{tbl:operators}.

$T_3=T_1\cap T_2$ & $\forall T_3[x]\in T_3$, we have $T_3[x]\in T_1$ and $T_3[x] \in T_2$\\

We say a sequence $T$ is consecutive 
if $\forall i \in (1,...,|T|-1), T[i+1] = T[i] + 1$.  We refer to each consecutive subsequence of $T$ as a \emph{segment}.
It is obvious that any time sequence $T$ can be decomposed into
segments and we say $T$ is \textit{L-consecutive}~\cite{li2015platoon} 
if the length of every segment is no smaller than $L$. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:platoon_weakpoint}, patterns adopting the notion of $L$-consecutiveness (e.g., \emph{platoon} and \emph{group}) still suffer from the \emph{loose connection} anomaly. 
To avoid such an anomaly without losing generality, we introduce a parameter $G$ to control the gaps between
timestamps in a pattern. Formally, a $G$-connected time sequence is defined as follows:

\begin{definition}[$G$-connected]
A time sequence $T$ is $G$-connected if the gap between any of its neighboring timestamps is no greater than $G$, i.e.,
 $\forall i \in (1,\ldots,|T|-1), T[i+1]-T[i] \leq G$.
\end{definition}

We take $T=(1,2,3,5,6)$ as an example. $T$ can be decomposed into two segments $(1,2,3)$ and $(5,6)$. $T$ is not $3$-consecutive since the length of $(5,6)$ is $2$. But it is safe to say either $T$ is $1$-consecutive or $2$-consecutive. On the other hand, $T$ is $2$-connected since the maximum gap between its neighboring timestamps is $2$. It is worth noting that $T$ is not $1$-connected because the gap between $T[3]$ and $T[4]$ is $2$ (i.e., $5-3=2$).

Given a trajectory database that is discretized into snapshots, we can conduct a clustering method, either disk-based or density-based, to identify groups with spatial proximity. Let $T$ be the set of timestamps in which a group of objects $O$ are clustered. We are ready to define a more general co-movement pattern:
\begin{definition}[General Co-Movement Pattern]
A general co-movement pattern finds a set of objects $O$ satisfying the following five constraints: (1) \textbf{closeness:} the objects in $O$ belong to the same cluster in the timestamps of $T$; (2) \textbf{significance:} $|O| \geq M$; (3) \textbf{duration:} $|T| \geq K$; (4) \textbf{consecutiveness:} $T$ is $L$-consecutive; and (5) \textbf{connection:} $T$ is $G$-connected.
\end{definition}
There are four parameters in our general co-movement pattern, including object constraint $M$ and temporal constraints $K,L,G$. 
%\revised{These parameters have different effects on the number of patterns discovered. Larger $K$, $L$, $M$ 
%put more stringent constraints on patterns such that less patterns could satisfy the requirements. Larger $G$
%relaxes the temporal constraints therefore more patterns could be discovered. Currently, we leave tuning of
%parameters to users to accommodate various application needs.}  
By customizing these parameters, our pattern can 
express other patterns proposed in the literature, as illustrated in Table~\ref{tbl:patterns}. 
In particular, by setting $G=|\mathbb{T}|$, we achieve the \emph{platoon} pattern. By setting $G=|\mathbb{T}|,L=1$, we reach the \emph{swarm} pattern. By setting $G=|\mathbb{T}|$, $M=2$, $K=1$, we gain the \emph{group} pattern. Finally by setting $G=1$, we result in the \emph{convoy} and \emph{flock} patterns. 
In addition to the flexibility of representing other existing patterns, our GCMP is able to avoid the \emph{loose connection} anomaly by tuning the parameter $G$. 
%It is notable that GCMP cannot be modeled by existing patterns.

Our definition of GCMP is independent of the clustering method. Users can apply different clustering methods to facilitate different application needs. 
We currently expose both disk-region based clustering and DBSCAN as options to the users. In summary, the goal of this paper is to present a parallel solution for discovering all the valid GCMPs from large-scale trajectory databases. Before we move on to the algorithmic part, we list the notations that are used in the following sections.
