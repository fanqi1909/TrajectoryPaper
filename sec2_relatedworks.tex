\section{Related Works}
\label{sec:related_works}
The \emph{co-movement patterns} in literature consist 
of five members, namely \emph{group}~\cite{wang2006grouppattern}, \emph{flock}~\cite{gudmundsson2004flock},
\emph{convoy}~\cite{jeung2008convoy}, \emph{swarm}~\cite{li2010swarm} and \emph{platoon}~\cite{li2015platoon}.
We have demonstrated the semantics of these patterns in Table~\ref{tbl:existing_co_patterns} and Figure~\ref{fig:related_work}.
In this section, we focus on comparing the techniques used in these works. 
For more trajectory patterns other than \emph{co-movement patterns}, 
interested readers may move to~\cite{zheng2015survey} for a comprehensive survey.


\subsection{Flock and Convoy}
The difference between \emph{flock} and \emph{convoy} lies 
in the object clustering methods. In \emph{flock}
objects are clustered based on their distance. Specifically, the
objects in the same cluster needs to have a pair-wised distance less than \emph{min\_dist}. 
This essentially requires the objects to be within a disk-region of delimiter less than \emph{min\_dist}.
In contrast, \emph{convoy} cluster the objects using density-based clustering~\cite{ester1996density}.
Technically, \emph{flock} utilizes a $m^{th}$-order Voronoi diagram~\cite{laube2005finding} to detect whether
a subset of object with size greater than $m$ stays in a disk-region. \emph{Convoy} employs
a trajectory simplification~\cite{douglas1973linesimplification} technique to boost pairwise distance computations in
the density-based clustering.
After clustering, both \emph{flock} and \emph{convoy} use a line-sweep 
method to scan each snapshots. During the scan, the object
group appears in consecutive timestamps is detected. Meanwhile, the object groups that do not
match the consecutive constraint are pruned. 
However, such a method faces high complexity issues when supporting other patterns.
For instance, in \emph{swarm}, the candidate set during the line-sweep grows
exponentially, and many candidates can only be pruned after the entire snapshots are scanned.

\subsection{Group, Swarm and Platoon}
Different from \emph{flock} and \emph{convoy}, all the \emph{group},\emph{swarm} and \emph{platoon}
patterns have more constraints on the pattern duration. Therefore, their techniques of mining are of
the same skeleton. The main idea of mining is to grow object set from an empty set
in a depth-first manner. During the growth, various pruning techniques are provided to prune 
unnecessary branches. \emph{Group} pattern uses the Apriori property among patterns to facilitate the pruning.
\emph{Swarm} adapts two more pruning rules called backward pruning and forward pruning. \emph{Platoon}
further adapts a prefix table structure to guide the depth-first search. As shown by Li et.al.~\cite{li2015platoon},
\emph{platoon} outperforms other two methods in efficiency. 
However, the three patterns are not able to directly discover the general co-movement pattern.
Furthermore, their pruning rules heavily rely on the depth-first search nature, which lost its efficiency
in the parallel scenario.

\subsection{Other Related Trajectory Patterns}
An closely related literature to co-moving patterns is the \emph{dynamic moving} patterns. Instead of requiring the same set of object traveling together, \emph{dynamic moving} patterns allow objects to temporally join or leave a group. Typical works include \emph{moving clusters}~\cite{kalnis2005movingclusters}, \emph{evolving convoy}~\cite{aung2010discovery}, \emph{gathering}~\cite{zheng2013gathering} etc. These works can not model our GCMP since they enforce the global consecutiveness on the timestamps of a pattern. 
\subsection{Trajectory Mining Frameworks}
Jinno et al. in~\cite{jinno2012paralleltpattern} designed a MapReduce based algorithm for efficiently support \emph{T}-pattern discovery, where a \emph{T}-pattern is a set of objects visiting the same place in a close time interval. Li et al. proposed a framework of processing online \emph{evolving group} pattern~\cite{li2013onlinegroup}, which focuses on supporting efficient update of arriving objects. 
As the natures of these work differs from co-movement pattern, there techniques cannot be directly applied to discover GCMPs.
