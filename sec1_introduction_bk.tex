\section{Introduction}
The prevalence of positioning devices has drastically boosted 
the scale and spectrum of trajectory collection to an unprecedented level. 
Tremendous amounts of trajectories, in the form of sequenced spatial-temporal 
records, are continually generated from animal telemetry chips, 
vehicle GPSs and wearable devices. Data analysis on large-scale 
trajectories benefits a wide range of applications and services, 
including traffic planning~\cite{zheng2011urban}, animal analysis~\cite{li2010miningperiodic}, and social recommendations~\cite{bao2013survey}, to name just a few.


A crucial task of data analysis on top of trajectories is 
to discover co-moving patterns. A \emph{co-movement} pattern~\cite{li2013managing} 
refers to a group of objects traveling together for a certain period of time 
and the group is normally determined according to spatial proximity. 
A pattern is prominent if the size of the group exceeds $M$ and the length of the duration exceeds $K$, where $M$ and $K$ are parameters specified by users. Rooted from such basic definition 
and driven by different mining applications, there are a bunch of variants 
of co-moving patterns that have been developed with more advanced constraints.

Table~\ref{tbl:existing_co_patterns} summarizes several popular co-moving patterns 
with different constraints in the attributes of clustering method and length of temporal duration. 
In particular,  the \emph{flock}~\cite{gudmundsson2006flock} 
and \emph{group}~\cite{wang2006grouppattern} patterns require 
all the objects in a group to be enclosed by a disk with radius $r$; 
whereas the \emph{convoy}~\cite{jeung2008convoy}, \emph{swarm}~\cite{li2010swarm} 
and \emph{platoon}~\cite{li2015platoon} patterns adopt density-based 
spatial clustering in determining groups. 
In the temporal dimension, \emph{flock}~\cite{gudmundsson2006flock} 
and \emph{convoy}~\cite{jeung2008convoy} require all the timestamps 
of each detected spatial group to be consecutive, which was referred to as \emph{global consecutiveness}; 
whereas \emph{swarm}~\cite{li2010swarm} does not impose any restriction. 
The \emph{group}~\cite{wang2006grouppattern} and \emph{platoon}~\cite{li2015platoon} use a compromised manner and allow gaps between the consecutive segments, which was referred to as \emph{local consecutiveness}. 
They introduce a parameter $L$ to control the minimum length of each local consecutive segment.


%Specifically, a \emph{flock}~\cite{gudmundsson2006flock} requires the group to be within a disk region of
%the user specified size.  A \emph{convoy}~\cite{jeung2008convoy} requires a group to be densely connected. Both \emph{flock}
%and \emph{convoy} require a group to appear for at least $k$ consecutive times.  
%\emph{Group}~\cite{wang2006grouppattern} and 
%\emph{Swarm}~\cite{li2010swarm} patterns relax the consecutiveness constraint, where non-consecutive timestamps are allowed in a pattern duration. \emph{Group} pattern require objects in a group to be within a disk region, while \emph{swarm}require the objects in a group to be densely connected.
%Recently,
%\emph{platoon}~\cite{li2015platoon} pattern is proposed to impose a fine-grained control on the consecutiveness of the duration. In \emph{platoon}, the duration of a group needs to have the local-consecutive portion of size no less than the user-specified $L$.

%To formally define the pattern, the temporal dimension of trajectories is descritized into snapshots, where each snapshot contains the geographical information of all moving objects. 
%Given a member size constraint $n$, a temporal constraint $k$, a \emph{co-movement} pattern finds a cluster of objects with at least size $n$ and close in spatial proximity for at least $k$ snapshots. 
%Recently, there have been several works extending the basic pattern to incorporate more advanced temporal constraints. For instance, Jeung et al. proposed \emph{convoy} pattern, which requires the snapshots to be consecutive; Li et al. proposed \emph{swarm} pattern, which relaxes the consecutiveness of snapshots and Li et al. proposed \emph{platoon} pattern which imposed a \emph{minimum local length} on the snapshots.

clusters of objects in each snapshots are denoted using dotted circles.}
\label{fig:related_work}
\end{figure}

%%We first provide a synthetic example to better illustrate these patterns in Figure~\ref{fig:related_work}, and the formal definitions are described in Section~\ref{sec:definition}.
%UPDATE THE FIGURE TO CONTAIN SIX SNAPSHOTS. USE A NEW REPRESENTATION OF THE PATTERN. I DON'T LIKE $\{o_1,o_2\}\{1,2,3\}$. USE ONE PAIR OF $\{\}$ ONLY.

We illustrate these co-movement patterns in Figure~\ref{fig:related_work} with an example of six trajectories.
The temporal dimension is discretized into six snapshots. 
In each snapshot, the objects are clustered as shown in the dotted circle.
By setting the parameters $M=2, K=3$, we are able to discover \emph{convoy}, \emph{flock}, and \emph{swarm} patterns. 
It is notable that \emph{convoy} and \emph{flock} have the same result pattern, this is because both patterns share 
the same constraints on the time duration. 
\emph{Swarm} pattern results in a super set of \emph{convoy} and \emph{flock} patterns, as it 
does not require any consecutiveness on the time duration. By setting $L=2$, we find three \emph{group} patterns. 
If further set $M=2,K=3$, two \emph{platoon} patterns are found. It is observable that the pattern $\{o_5,o_6:1,4,5\} \rangle$ is a \emph{swarm} but is neither a \emph{platoon} nor a \emph{group} since one of its local consecutive duration (i.e. $\{1\}$) is less than $2$. However, $\{o_5,o_6:1,4,5\} \rangle$ can be reduced to $\langle\{o_5,o_6:4,5\} \rangle$ which is a \emph{group} pattern because \emph{group} pattern only restricts the local consecutiveness but not the total size of a duration. 

% we achieve two \emph{platoon} patterns.
% 
%By setting $M=2$, the spatial clusters with at least $2$ objects are displayed with the same shape. Since \emph{Convoy} pattern requires the set of objects to be clustered for $k$ \emph{consecutive} snapshots, there results in only one such pattern ($\{o_3,o_4\}\{t_1,t_2,t_3\}$) when $k$ is set to $3$. \emph{Swarm} pattern relaxes the consecutiveness of duration, thus there are three patterns discovered. \emph{Platoon} pattern requires that each local consecutive duration needs to have at least certain length, which is indicated by an additional parameter $l$. When $l$ equals 2, there are two patterns discovered. Note that $\{o_6,o_7\}\{t_1,t_4,t_5\}$ is not included in the platoon pattern since $t_1$ is the local consecutive snapshot with duration 1, which is less than $l$. CAN WE SUPPORT THE GROUP AND FLOCK PATTERN? IF YES, WHY NOT PUT THEM IN THE FIGURE?

%We notice that, \emph{platoon} pattern is more general than \emph{convoy} and \emph{swarm}. This is because by setting appropriate $l$, \emph{platoon} can be reduced to \emph{convoy} and \emph{swarm} respectively~\cite{li2015platoon}. However, we observe that \emph{platoon} pattern is to loose on the temporal domain thus may result in less significant patterns. For example in Figure~\ref{fig:platoon_weakpoint}.

%\label{fig:platoon_weakpoint}
%\end{figure}

%In platoon, a pattern for $n=2,k=4,l=2$ could be $\{o_1, o_2\}\{t_1,t_2,t_4,t_5,t_{100},t_{101}\}$. However, the snapshots $t_{100}$ and $t_{101}$ is too far away from previous snapshots. Such two snapshots are in less relation with previous snapshots and thus should be removed from the pattern. Based on this observation, we defined a \emph{generalized co-moving} pattern (as in Section~\ref{sec:definition}) to provide a more fine granular control of the pattern. In \emph{generalized co-moving} pattern, a parameter $g$ is introduce the control the \emph{maximum gap} allowed between consecutive snapshots. By so doing our generalized co-moving pattern is more expressive and can represent all the existing co-moving patterns.

%In step with the advances in localization technologies, the growth in the volume of trajectory data is rapid. Traditional single-machine methods face severe scalability problem in handling large trajectory data. For example, as reported in~\cite{li2015platoon}, a \emph{Swarm} pattern takes around 100 seconds to discover for 100k trajectories. With upto billions of trajectories in nowadays datasets, such approaches apparently become unfeasible. To tackle this challenge, we propose a  paralleled solution for discovering \emph{generalized co-moving} patterns. We then deploy our idea on the modern MapReduce platform. As our experiments show, our solution achieves well load-balance and can process billions of trajectories in XXX seconds. Several optimizations are also designed to boost our solution to be orders of magnitudes faster than baseline algorithms.

%In practice, it is cumbersome to design tailed solutions to different types of co-movement pattern discovery. 

%In reality, it is cumbersome to design tailed solutions to support 
%generality and scalability

%In this paper, our primary objectives are solving two 

As can be seen, there are various co-movement patterns requested by different applications and it is cumbersome to design a tailored solution for each type. Hence, there is a particular demand for a general platform to support all these co-movement patterns. The other issue with existing methods is that they are built on top of centralized indexes that are not scalable. To the best of our knowledge, the maximum number of trajectories ever evaluated is up to hundreds of thousands of trajectories. In practice, it is rather common to collect at least millions of trajectories and their scalability is left unknown. We, for the first time, evaluate the pattern mining performance at the million scale and report the performance in Figure~\ref{}. The results show that their performances degrade dramatically as the dataset size scales up. In fact, as shown in Table~\ref{tbl:existing_co_patterns}, the mining of co-movement patterns require high complexity. For instance, the
complexities of \emph{swarm} and \emph{platoon} are already exponential. 
Therefore, none of them can handle millions of trajectories efficiently. 
%CAN YOU ANALYSE THEIR COMPLEXITY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF SCALABILITY.

Therefore, our primary contributions in this paper are to close these two gaps. First, we propose a general co-movement pattern definition to incorporate all the related variants in the existing literature. We observe that even though \emph{platoon} is the most general pattern among existing patterns, it suffers from \emph{loose connection} problem. 
The \emph{loose connection} problem refers to the patterns that discovered 
are loosely-connected in the temporal domain. For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:platoon_weakpoint}, two objects $o_1, o_2$ 
would form a \emph{platoon} pattern $\{o_1,o_2:1,2,3, 102,103,104\}$. However, the consecutive segment on the pattern's 
duration is $98$ timestamps apart, making the co-movement behavior very weak.
%
%
%%This is because that \emph{platoon} allows the timestamps in a pattern duration to be in arbitrary distance, making the object group loosely
%connected. For instance, patterns with duration $\{1,2,100,101\}$ could be a valid \emph{platoon}; however, the two timestamps $2,100$ are too far from each other.
In reality, such a pattern is likely to be induced by periodic movements of unrelated objects such as, vehicles stopping at the same petrol station, animals pausing at the same water source etc. To cope with this anomaly, we propose the \emph{general co-movement pattern} by introducing the gap parameter $G$, which requires the distance of timestamps in the duration to be no larger than $G$. By so doing, we gain a fine-grained control over the pattern duration, which alleviates the \emph{loose connection} problem. Meanwhile, the general co-movement pattern does not concede its expressiveness. As we show in later sections, the general co-movement pattern is able to express existing patterns by setting appropriate parameters. 
%IS IT POSSIBLE TO USE FIGURE 1 TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF PLATOON, INSTEAD OF PROPOSING A NEW EXAMPLE SCENARIO?

Second, we propose a parallel solution on modern MapReduce platforms for scalable pattern mining.
The major challenge in designing MapReduce-based algorithms is to make proper partitions of input data.
In GCMP mining, we enforce both the \emph{soundness} and the \emph{completeness} 
of the partitions. Such properties ensure that neither false-patterns 
nor miss-patterns are possible in our solution. To meet such partition requirements
as well as to keep the shuffle amount to a minimum,
% 
%%Second, we propose a . Our
%%solution is a three-step MapReduce alike approach. First, trajectories are partitioned
%%into snapshots where clusters from each snapshots are formed in parallel. Second, 
%%clusters at various timestamps are shuffled and regrouped. Third, the general co-movement patterns
%%are mined from each group. 
%
%The challenge here is to ensure that
%the patterns mined at step three is complete. If not, further shuffles and computations are required which 
%significantly drag down the system performance. In order to resolve the challenges and meanwhile keep the 
%shuffle amount at each stage to a minimum, 
we first design a naive \emph{Temporal Replication and Mining} (TRM)
approach, which partitions trajectories into groups of consecutive snapshots. Then, we design a line-sweep
method for mining GCMP from each partition. We prove that in TRM, the partition is complete and sound when a snapshot is replicated $O(|T|)$ times. 
Then, we design a novel \emph{Star Partition and Mining} (SRM) approach which significantly reduces the data shuffled
as compare to TRM. In SRM, we design a conceptual connection graph based on proximity among objects. We adapt
a \emph{star partition} which cut the graph by replicating vertices. Afterwards, we design an Apriori-like method to mine
GCMP in each partition. We prove the correctness of SPM and show that total data been replicated is $O(|\mathbb{O}|)$.
Moreover, we utilize \emph{temporal monotonicity} in GCMP to further reduce the shuffling and mining cost in SPM. Lastly, we adapt various engineering level techniques to support efficiently deploying our algorithms in 
Apache Spark which is one of the most popular MapReduce platforms.

%we design a novel star-based partition scheme to efficiently partition objects based on their
%belonging clusters. Based on the star partition, we then propose a series of optimization techniques which
%largely improve the system performance. NEED TO EMPHASIZE YOUR TECHNICAL CONTRIBUTION!

Third, we conduct a set of extensive experiments on XXX datasets with million-scale trajectories. The results show that XXX.
